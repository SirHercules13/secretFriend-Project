# Secret Friend Project
This project was developed through the Alura development course, wich I learned how to:

- Declare a variable of type Array to represent a list;
- Add an element to an Array with the `push` function;
- Use code already developed by third parties to shuffle elements in an Array.
- Perform information validations, using conditionals;
- Interrupt the execution of a function, using `return`;
- Get the number of elements in an Array, with the `length` property;
- Check if an element exists in an Array, using the `includes` function.
